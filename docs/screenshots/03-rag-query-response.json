    "answer": "Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n\n### Key Features:\n1. **Container Orchestration**: Manages the lifecycle of containers, ensuring they are running as intended.\n2. **Automation**: Automates tasks such as deployment, scaling, and updates of applications.\n3. **Scalability**: Easily scales applications up or down based on demand.\n4. **Self-healing**: Automatically replaces and reschedules containers from failed nodes.\n\n### Core Concepts:\n- **Pods**: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, which can contain one or more containers.\n- **Services**: Abstracts access to a set of Pods, providing a stable endpoint for communication.\n- **Deployments**: Manages the deployment of Pods, allowing for updates and rollbacks.\n- **Namespaces**: Provides a mechanism for isolating resources within a cluster.\n\nKubernetes works by managing clusters of nodes (machines) that run containerized applications. It schedules and deploys containers across these nodes, ensuring optimal resource utilization and application availability [Document 1]. \n\nIn summary, Kubernetes simplifies the management of containerized applications through automation and orchestration, making it easier to deploy and scale applications in a cloud environment.",
